# Linux Commands Learned 

1. Command Substitution — $( ... )

Allows the output of a command to be used as an argument to another command.

Example:


echo "Today is $(date)"

Explanation: Prints "Today is" followed by the current date and time.


2. Redirections — <, 2>, &>

Redirect input, output, and errors in commands.

Examples:

cat < config.txt | grep "text" file.txt 2> errors.log
python script.py &> output.log

Explanation:

* `<` : Redirect input from a file.
* `2>` : Redirect standard error to a file.
* `&>` : Redirect both standard output and standard error to a file.


3. Command Grouping — { ...; } and ( ... )

Group multiple commands to execute together or redirect their output collectively.

Example:

{ echo "Starting"; uptime; } > log.txt


Explanation: Executes both commands together and saves their combined output in `log.txt`.


4. Brace Expansion — { ... }

Generates multiple text strings or paths, useful for creating multiple files or directories at once.

Example:

mkdir project/{src,bin,docs}

Explanation: Creates directories `project/src`, `project/bin`, and `project/docs` in one command.
